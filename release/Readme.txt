Kezyma's UI Remastered

This is a WIP UI replacement for Morrowind, eventually intending to completely replace all UI elements in the game. While at this early stage, I have packaged everything in a modular way so you can pick and choose which aspects of UI Remastered you'd like to use.


00 - Cursors
This first pack is a replacement for the cursors in Morrowind. I really liked the style of the cursors in Morrowind UI Revamped and so these cursors share the rough shape of those icons, although with only a light bevel to keep them clean.


01 - Main Menu Buttons
This pack replaces the buttons on the main menu and the in-game escape menu. I've gone for clean text with a slight bevel to give it a bit of depth. 

Has support for the following main menu additions:
Continue adds a 'Continue' button to load your last save. I may include this as an optional addon in future.
Morrowind Script Extender﻿ adds a 'Mod Config' option to manage mwse mods.


02 - Book & Scroll Buttons
I really liked what UI Revamped was trying to do with using icons in place of text for some of the journal buttons, so I've taken this to the next step and replaced almost every book and scroll button with an icon-based button.


03 - UI & HUD Elements
This pack is mostly just bordering for buttons and UI windows. I've removed the thicker borders and given the thinner borders a cleaner look. I've also altered the header bar and turned it into two thinner bars for a bit of a simpler design. I've also redesigned the scroll bar to make it match the new design a bit better.

The HUD Elements contain support for MGE XE - HUD Mods﻿ Time display mod, replacing the letters and numbers used.

04 - Stat Bars
This just replaces the Health, Magic and Fatigue bars with new ones using less of a gradient.


05 - Item Icon Frames
This replaces the background for enchanted weapons and introduces cleaner versions of the borders sused for equipped items and during bartering.


06 - Crosshairs
There are two crosshair options.

The Morrowind crosshairs are a slightly smaller version of the vanilla crosshair and an ownership icon that pairs with it nicely and is less intrusive than the red hand icon commonly used.

The Skywind crosshairs is the crosshair made by Left4No, along with a modified version to use as an ownership icon.

If you want the ownership indicator to work, you'll either want;
MGE XE - HUD Mods﻿ from optional files, you'll only need the ownership indicator plugin. or
Ownership Indicator﻿ if you want a plugin-free version, which I may include as an optional script in this package in future.


07 - Skill & Magic Icons
I've made three packs of replacers for skill and magic icons. This also includes replacers for the filter icons in UI Expansion.

The Smooth pack is close to vanilla, but without the rough, brick-like texture of the icon, replacing it with a smoother, almost painted look.

The Borderless pack is the actual symbol from the icon, coloured in and with a black background, which looks much cleaner and more modern than the vanilla icons. It also makes it easier to learn and recognise icons on the fly compared to vanilla, where all icons look just like little coloured squares.

The Borderless Transparent pack is the same as the borderless one, but with the black background being transparent instead. It looks better if you have menu transparency on, but can look a little strange in places.

Both packs support the following mods:
Magicka Expanded﻿ adds various new spells.
UI Expansion adds filters to the menu with their own icons.


08 - Item Icons
I've made two packs of replacers for item icons, both are based on the Ultimate Icon Replacer pack. They also include a new gold icon that I made using a photo of the coin from the Oblivion Collector's Edition.

The Crisp pack is a slightly sharper and more 3D looking versions of the icons, I tried to make them look more like small items as opposed to icons for them here. They look the best with the new Item Icon Frames.

The Material pack is a flattened version of the icons, looking similar to Material UI Design icons. They aren't as easy to distinugish as the regular icons, but provide a slightly more modern web design feeling.

Both packs support Tamriel Data and any of the mods that use it as a base.


09 - Splash Screens - INCOMPLETE
A small pack of splash screens using screenshots from my game with some visual effects. I'll remove lower quality screens and add new ones over time.


10 - Book & Scroll Textures
A replacement for the book and scroll background textures as well as the journal bookmark.

11 - Alt Cursor
An optional replacement for the main cursor for those who don't like the current one. You'll still need the original pack for the other cursors. In the future this may become a full alternative pack.

Suggested Mods
This mod is intended to be used with the following mods. In the future I may bundle or reimplement some of these in this mod, but for the time being, it's suggested to get and install these first.

Morrowind Code Patch
You'll need to use the setting that allows mods to detect ownership if you want the custom crosshair for that to work. You'll also need the next mod.

Ownership Indicator﻿
To get the ownership indicator working!

UI Expansion
The staple UI mod, adds a whole bunch of stuff, but most notably, filtering.

QuickLoot
Modern looting for modern times. 

Hotkeys Extended
More hotkeys, less trawling through menus.

HUD Weapon Charge
See your weapon charge without pausing the game.

Descriptive Descriptions
Tooltips Complete
Better tooltips for everyone.

Animated Main Menu for Morrowind
By far the best Main Menu replacer around.

Better Dialogue Font
You've made the UI look crisp and new, why not make the font match it.
